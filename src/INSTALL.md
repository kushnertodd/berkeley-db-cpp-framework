### JetBrains CLion <a id="jetbrains-clion"/>
[JetBrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/#section=windows) is a free C++ IDE.
The Berekeley DB C++ Framework is a Cmake project.
JetBrains has a 
[tutorial](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/quick-cmake-tutorial.html)
on setting up CLion for a Cmake project.

### WSL2 Linux distribution for Windows 10 <a id="windows-10-wsl2-linux-distributions"/>
WSL2 is a native Linux running under Windows 10.
These are instructions for installing [Windows 10 WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).
WSL2 has specific [hardware requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting?source=recommendations),
including a 64-bit processor with second-level address translation (SLAT) and at least 4GB of RAM. Any new Intel Windows system should be adequate.
The command to [install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) WSL2 on Windows 10 is:
```
$ wsl --install
```
The install instructions are currently for Pengwin or Ubuntu.
The Linux build is currently tested on Windows 10 WSL2 with [Pengwin](https://www.whitewaterfoundry.com/),

#### Linux Distributions
Linux development was done under Windows 10 WSL2 with [Pengwin](https://www.whitewaterfoundry.com/), 
which may be obtained from the Microsoft Store.
[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview)
may also be obtained from the Microsoft Store.
The instructions likely work for other types of Linux,
such as CentOS, 
or other types of Unix, 
such as MacOS, possibly with modifications.
These are [instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/use-custom-distro)
for installing other WSL2 Linux distributions.

### Windows Terminal <a id="windows-terminal-tool"/>
You likely would like to use [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal)
to develop using WSL2 Linux.
Windows Terminal may be obtained from the Microsoft Store.
This is a Microsoft [tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install) for starting with Windows Terminal.
Scott Hanselman has an excellent [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC-gLkYWXLw) on using Windows Terminal.

### Linux Build Tools <a id="linux-build-tools"/>
There are several Linux C++ libraries and tools required for the build.
Pengwin and Ubuntu use the`apt`command to install many Linux library and tool packages:

```
Always run`apt update`before`install`.
Some packages are not available under`apt`, or some`apt`packages
have versions that are too old to use.
In those cases, they can be directly downloaded from a web site or built from source.

The Linux`build-essentials`package installs the C++ compiler, 
debugger, libraries, other development tools required for the build.
`build-essential`includes:
  - [g++, gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
  - [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
